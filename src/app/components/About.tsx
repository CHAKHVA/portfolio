                C#/.NET and Python/Django, while I also maintain a solid
                understanding of front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                JavaScript, ReactJS, NextJS, Tailwind, and SCSS. I excel at
                building and managing robust server-side applications, writing
                clean, efficient, and scalable code. I am also a team player who
                thrives in collaborating with cross-functional teams to produce
                outstanding web applications.
